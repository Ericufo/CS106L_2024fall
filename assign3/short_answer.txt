Make a Class
------------

Q1. Whatâ€™s const-correctness and why is it important?
A1.  Const-correctness ensures that variables, methods, 
and parameters not meant to be modified are protected from changes. 
It improves code safety, readability, optimization, and compatibility by enforcing immutability where needed.

Q2. Is your class const-correct? How do you know?
A2.  Yes, the class is const-correct. 
Methods like getName, getCost, getAttack, and printInfo are marked as const, 
ensuring they do not modify the object. 
Non-const methods like addTrait appropriately modify the internal state as intended.
